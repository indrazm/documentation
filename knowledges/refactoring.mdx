title: Refactoring

<Warning>
  This just to add more knowledge, that we aware of, refactoring should be prevented from happening which we need to write good code in the first place
</Warning>

The main purpose of refactoring is to fight technical debt. It transforms a mess into clean code and simple design. Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. It's essentially improving the internal structure of software while preserving its functionality

### What is Refactoring

- **Code improvement**: It's about making code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand.
- **Internal restructuring**: Refactoring changes how the code is organized internally without altering what the code does from an external perspective.
- **Incremental changes**: It typically involves making small, incremental changes rather than large-scale rewrites.
- **Preserving functionality**: The key principle is that the code's external behavior remains the same after refactoring.

### Why We Need to Refactor

- **Improve readability**: Makes code easier to understand for current and future developers.
- **Enhance maintainability**: Simplifies the process of fixing bugs and adding new features.
- **Reduce complexity**: Simplifies overly complex code structures, making the system easier to work with.
- **Improve performance**: Can often lead to more efficient code execution.
- **Remove duplication**: Eliminates repeated code, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- **Prepare for changes**: Makes the codebase more flexible and adaptable to future requirements.
- **Pay off technical debt**: Addresses shortcuts or quick fixes implemented in the past.
- **Improve scalability**: Restructures code to better handle growth and increased demands.
- **Enhance testability**: Often makes code easier to test, which can improve overall quality.
- **Apply design patterns**: Allows for the implementation of proven design solutions to common problems.
- **Facilitate code reviews**: Cleaner code is easier for team members to review and understand.
- **Boost team morale**: Working with well-structured code can increase developer satisfaction and productivity.
- **Reduce bugs**: Well-structured code is often less prone to bugs and easier to debug when issues do arise.
- **Improve onboarding**: Makes it easier for new team members to understand and work with the codebase.

It's important to note that refactoring should be done carefully, ideally with a good suite of tests in place to ensure that functionality isn't accidentally changed. It's often best practiced as an ongoing process rather than a one-time event, with developers continually making small improvements as they work with the code.
