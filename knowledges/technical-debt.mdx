title: Technical Debt
---

Technical debt is a concept in software development that refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy or quick solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer to implement.
Technical debt is like financial debt, but for code and systems. When developers take shortcuts or use quick fixes to meet deadlines, they accumulate "debt" that will need to be "paid back" later through additional work.

### Why it matters

- **Future costs**: Technical debt increases the difficulty and cost of future changes and improvements.
- **Reduced productivity**: As debt accumulates, developers spend more time working around problems rather than adding new features.
- **Decreased quality**: Systems with high technical debt are often more prone to bugs and performance issues.
- **Increased risk**: It can lead to system failures or make it harder to respond to new market demands quickly.

### Why Technical Debt is Happening

#### Business pressure

Sometimes business circumstances might force you to roll out features before they're completely finished. In this case, patches and kludges will appear in the code to hide the unfinished parts of the project.

#### Lack of understanding of the consequences of technical debt

Sometimes you might not understand that technical debt has “interest” insofar as it slows down the pace of development as debt accumulates. This can make it too difficult to dedicate the team's time to refactoring because management doesn't see the value of it.

#### Failing to combat the strict coherence of components

This is when the project resembles a monolith rather than the product of individual modules. In this case, any changes to one part of the project will affect others. Team development is made more difficult because it's difficult to isolate the work of individual members.

#### Lack of tests

The lack of immediate feedback encourages quick, but risky workarounds or kludges. In worst cases, these changes are implemented and deployed right into the production without any prior testing. The consequences can be catastrophic. For example, an innocent-looking hotfix might send a weird test email to thousands of customers or even worse, flush or corrupt an entire database.

#### Lack of documentation

This slows down the introduction of new people to the project and can grind development to a halt if key people leave the project.

#### Lack of interaction between team members

If the knowledge base isn't distributed throughout the company, people will end up working with an outdated understanding of processes and information about the project. This situation can be exacerbated when junior developers are incorrectly trained by their mentors.

#### Long-term simultaneous development in several branches

This can lead to the accumulation of technical debt, which is then increased when changes are merged. The more changes made in isolation, the greater the total technical debt.

#### Delayed refactoring

The project's requirements are constantly changing and at some point it may become obvious that parts of the code are obsolete, have become cumbersome, and must be redesigned to meet new requirements.

On the other hand, the project's programmers are writing new code every day that works with the obsolete parts. Therefore, the longer refactoring is delayed, the more dependent code will have to be reworked in the future.

#### Incompetence

This is when the developer just doesn't know how to write decent code.
