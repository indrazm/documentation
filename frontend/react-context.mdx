When you have multiple Context Providers (e.g., around 10), it's important to structure your code in a way that keeps your application maintainable and understandable. Here are some best practices to consider when structuring your context providers:

1. Create a Separate File for Each Context
   Instead of having all your context logic in a single file, create a separate file for each context. This keeps your code organized and allows you to manage and maintain each context independently.

Example File Structure:

```
src/
  ├── context/
  │   ├── AuthContext.js
  │   ├── ThemeContext.js
  │   ├── LanguageContext.js
  │   ├── UserContext.js
  │   ├── SettingsContext.js
  │   └── index.js
  ├── components/
  │   └── App.js
  └── ...

```

2. Create an index.js File for Context Exports
   In your context folder, you can create an index.js file that exports all your contexts. This makes it easier to import them elsewhere in your application.

Example src/context/index.ts:

```ts
export { AuthProvider, useAuth } from "./AuthContext";
export { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from "./ThemeContext";
export { LanguageProvider, useLanguage } from "./LanguageContext";
export { UserProvider, useUser } from "./UserContext";
export { SettingsProvider, useSettings } from "./SettingsContext";
```

3. Combine Providers in a Higher-Level Component
   You can create a higher-level component that wraps all your context providers. This can also be placed in a separate file, typically called something like AppProviders.js.

Example AppProviders.js:

```ts
import React from "react";
import { AuthProvider } from "./context/AuthContext";
import { ThemeProvider } from "./context/ThemeContext";
import { LanguageProvider } from "./context/LanguageContext";
import { UserProvider } from "./context/UserContext";
import { SettingsProvider } from "./context/SettingsContext";

const AppProviders = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <LanguageProvider>
          <UserProvider>
            <SettingsProvider>{children}</SettingsProvider>
          </UserProvider>
        </LanguageProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </AuthProvider>
  );
};

export default AppProviders;
```

4. Use the Combined Provider in Your Main App Component
   Now, you can wrap your main App component (often found in App.js) with your AppProviders component.

```ts
import React from "react";
import AppProviders from "./AppProviders";
import MainComponent from "./MainComponent";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AppProviders>
      <MainComponent />
    </AppProviders>
  );
};

export default App;
```

5. Use Custom Hooks to Simplify Access
   For each context, create custom hooks that allow components to easily access the context values. This abstracts away the use of Context and makes it easier to work with.

6. Consider Performance Implications
   If you’re using multiple contexts, monitor performance and rendering behavior. If you have components that consume values from multiple contexts, you might find that re-renders happen more frequently than desired. Consider using React.memo or React.useMemo appropriately to optimize rendering.

Summary

- Structure each context in its own file.
- Create an index file for easier imports.
- Combine your contexts in a single provider component to keep your main App clean.
- Use custom hooks for easy access to context data.
- Keep performance in mind, especially with many contexts in use.
